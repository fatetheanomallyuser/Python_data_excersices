Project: Data Science Code Comparison
This project delves into optimizing Python-based database interactions for data science workflows. By comparing two scripts, it highlights:

Script 1: Utilizing mysql.connector with pandas. While functional, it involves more code complexity and management overhead, making it less suitable for large-scale applications.
Script 2: Leveraging SQLAlchemy with pandas. This approach demonstrates better scalability, cleaner code, and reduced management effort, making it ideal for real-world data processing and analysis tasks.
The project aims to provide actionable insights into choosing the right tools to improve efficiency and scalability in data science practices.
